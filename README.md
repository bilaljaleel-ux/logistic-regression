Logistic Regression, classification metrics, and threshold analysis using Python
# Logistic Regression & Model Evaluation

This repository contains my work focused on classification models,
Logistic Regression, and proper model evaluation techniques.

## Topics Covered
- Confusion matrix interpretation
- Precision, recall, and F1-score
- Class imbalance in classification problems
- Decision threshold (cutoff) analysis
- Logistic Regression probability modeling
- Interpretation of coefficients and odds ratios

## Datasets Used
- Optiva loan default dataset
- Oscars demo dataset (binary classification example)

## Key Learning
Accuracy alone is not sufficient for evaluating classification models,
especially with imbalanced data. This project demonstrates how probabilities,
threshold selection, and evaluation metrics should be aligned with business
objectives.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
